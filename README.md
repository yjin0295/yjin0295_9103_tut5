1. **Technique "Pointillism" Inspiration:**

The artwork with a multitude of umbrellas inspires me to blend small, distinct points of pictures for a coherent and detailed image. I'd like to incorporate the visual effect into final project. When I click one position, an umbrella of random size and color appears in that position. The background will be rainy sky controlled by scroll. The bigger the rain is, the more umbrellas in the screen. Pointillism enhances the visual appeal of the project and implies a bustling crowd by umbrellas. It offers a unique and captivating interactive experience to engage the audience. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;width: 100%;">
     <img src="/assets/umbrella1.jpeg" alt="The umbrellas are beautiful!" title="umbrella" width="200">
    <img src="/assets/umbrella3.jpg" alt="The umbrellas are beautiful!" title="umbrella" width="300">
</div>


2. **Coding Technique:**

Function draw and function setup generate multiple circles with varying sizes and colors dynamically, which can be used in drawing umbrellas. Function mousePressed allows users to interact with the canvas by clicking and creating a new random umbrella. The frameCount can be used in adjusting intensity of the "rain" by controlling the number of umbrellas on the screen.
